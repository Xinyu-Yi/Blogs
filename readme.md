## Welcome to My Blogs

This is the personal [blog](https://xinyu-yi.github.io/Blogs/) collection of [Xinyu Yi](https://xinyu-yi.github.io/), where I share insights, technical discussions, and research updates related to human motion capture, IMUs, and beyond. Each post reflects my ongoing work, explorations, and thoughts in these areas. I hope these writings are helpful, inspiring, or at least thought-provoking to readers.

Feel free to browse through the posts and check back for updates.
